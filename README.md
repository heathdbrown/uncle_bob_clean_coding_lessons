Expectations:

What we might profess in our profession as developers.

I Expect...

1. We will not ship shit. (Everything works)
> All users expect a working product, with very few issues. Even yourself! Deliver.

2. We will always be ready. (Always ready to deploy)
> Interation lengths for the Mercury space capsule was 1 day. Write unit tests in the morning and pass in the afternoon.

> We are satisfied today with 1 week or 2 weeks

> We should be READY to deploy in that interation, it may not have enough features to deploy but technically should be ready.

> Docs done, tests done.

> At the end of a iteration, you should have shippable code. If you do not have something ready to deploy you are not doing Agile.

> Burn in periods are false hopes. You should have the tests to prove your system is working and be shippable.

3. Stable Productivity

> The longer the project goes, the slower you DON'T get.

> Features are produced at the same rate at the beginning, middle, and end.

> Example: minimal estimate was 6 months for everything, because the cost of missing an estimate was so high (professionally and personally all items were overly estimated).

4. Inexpesive adaptability

> Cheap and easy to make changes to the system.

> The cost of the change should be proportional to size of the request.
